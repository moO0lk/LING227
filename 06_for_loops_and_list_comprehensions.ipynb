        "# Traversal using `for` loops\n",
        "\n",
        "Being able to repeat the same action over a large set of data is one of the many benefits of learning how to use a programming language. One of the most fundamental ways to repeat an action is through the use of `for loops`. These are called `for loops` because they *loop* or repeat through a sequence of data, objects, values, or whatever you want to call them.\n",
        "\n",
        "What does the `for` mean? The use of \"for\" provides a hint about the way we control `for loops` â€” *for* specifies the units that will be looped over.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's pretend we had a pile of documents that we wanted to shred. Our unit of measurement in this case is an individual document. So, if we wanted to shred each document one at a time, we could formalise this process using the following statement:\n",
        "\n",
        ">`for each document in all of my documents:`  \n",
        "\n",
        ">> `shred the document`  \n",
        "\n",
        "`... repeat until I run out of documents...`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying this idea to Python, a `for loop` allows us to traverse an entire sequence and operate on elements of that sequence. For example, for each value in a sequence, we could:\n",
        "\n",
        "- print the value\n",
        "- use a built-in method\n",
        "- create a new variable based on the value\n",
        "- update a counter\n",
        "- perform a conditional test\n",
        "- etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "Much like the `if` statements, the `for` loop will contain a header with a colon followed by an indented body:\n",

        "So now that you've learned `for loops`, it's time to learn an alternative method which is commonly used in Python. This alternative method is effectively an efficient shorthand for looping and unpacking, which you will see used excessivly in the NLTK book as well as almost anywhere else someone is using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "This alternative format is known as a `list comprehension`. List comprehensions are good because they provide efficiency, but they can be a bit tricky to interpret when you first see them.\n",

        "The general syntax of a list comprehension is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "> `[statement/expression for value in sequence/generator]`\n",
        "\n",
        "The list comprehension above uses `[]`, just like a list, and will indeed return a list of values which meet the statement or expression indicated in the *first* part of the list comprehension.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next cell you will see a simple list comprehension. You'll note in the example below  says `letter for letter`, which can be interpreted as \"for each value, give me the value\". This is the basic way to unpack a sequence into a `list`, rather than spitting each value out one-at-a-time like a `for loop`.\n",
