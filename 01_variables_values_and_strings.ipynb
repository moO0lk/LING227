        "The main difference here is that `len()` and `print()` required putting the variable or value inside the brackets, whereas the other functions require putting the variable or string first and typing the `.function()` afterwards.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first kind of function, such as `print()` and `len()` are functions not specific to any one type or class. The second kind, such as `.upper()` are specific to a type (strings), and thus that function can only be used on values of that type. You can think of the `.function()` style as a tail which belongs to a specific animal. Foxes can only use fox tails, and dogs can only use dog tails. Strings can only use string functions, and other types can only use their functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Later on, this distinction becomes fuzzy when we start importing functions from different libraries, because we can use the `.function()` method to call functions from libraries, or import them directly. But the general principle still remains - functions which are specific to *something* (either a type, library, or module) can be called using the `.` notation. You can see this below, where I can import a library (called `math`) and then use the `.fsum()` function to calculate the sum of two numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the second cell, I import *just* the function, which makes it available without needing to use the `.` notation. This may be confusing right now, so don't worry if it doesn't make immediate sense! But you'll notice how different strategies for importing influence the way that functions are available in a notebook or a program.\n"
